// The changes made by this mod give much less drag at low angles of attack.
// this is significantly more realistic, but now the already ridiculous body lift of KSP becomes even more overpowered.
// to the point of being able to have a 3.5 glide ratio at 15 degrees, or even a 7.5 glide ratio at 45 degrees, for literally just cylindrical tanks. 
// mind you that at 45 degrees the drag is already half of what it is at its maximum. So that'd be 3.75 times their maximum drag as lift.
// this is patently ridiculous, a landing space shuttle or a concorde glide at a 4.5 glide ratio. It's what lifting body reentry vehicles get. A cylindrical tank shouldn't beat that ever.
// so: cut the body lift multiplier by 6, which gives a maximum L/D of only like 1.2-ish for cylindrical tanks.
